PLSortableUI
============

This is an angular directive to do a sortable UI.

Has some dependecies, but are common for the majority of projects.

To use you just clone th repository in your system

Run a virtual host (e.x. localhost/PLSortableUI)

See it running.

There are TODO's, I know, needs time...


Hope this help...
